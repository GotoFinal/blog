Welcome on my Java/Diorite blog!

Hi! I'm Bart≈Çomiej Mazur aka GotoFinal from Poland.  
I'm a Java developer currently working as Plugin developer for PrimeMC Minecraft server.  
But don't worry, this blog isn't about Minecraft, but about Java or other JVM languages.  
On this blog you can find posts about my projects or many interesting facts about Java or JVM related stuff, like bytecode generation, JIT optimizations, benchmarks etc.

My current biggest project is **Diorite** - Minecraft server software, but it contains a lot of features that are not related to Minecraft, like own injection system, configuration system etc.  

If you want to hire me: **gotofinaldev@gmail.com**

Test:

{% highlight java %}  
class A { public static UnknownType field; }  
class B { public static void test(UnknownType arg){} }  
class C { public static UnknownType test(UnknownType arg){return arg;} }  
class D { public static UnknownType test(UnknownType arg){throw new RuntimeException();} }  
{% endhighlight %}
